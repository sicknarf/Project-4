### Challenges & Successes

The biggest challenge on this app was rendering the site based off of which user was accessing the app. It felt like I was programming two apps at the same time, but pulling it off felt incredibly rewarding. I do, however, wish that I had implented more functionality and complexity in the app itself. The challenge I faced that prevented this was working as a projections programmer at the same time as this project week, so I had no time outside of class to research or reach out and attend office hours to get feedback on my code. In the same vein, I was able to get full CRUD successfully up and running in spite of that.
